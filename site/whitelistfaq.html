</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I purchase a license for my music promotion channel?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Music promotion channels of any sort are not eligible to purchase our license but you can <a href="https://www.monstercat.com/contact-us">contact us</a> to ask if you qualify for complimentary whitelisting.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do I get the music?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>For streamers seeking background music you can listen to our music directly from Monstercat.com, our Twitch channel, YouTube channel, or use your preferred music app.
  For those wanting to download our music you can purchase Monstercat Gold for $5/mo to get full download access to our catalog, as well as early streaming access to new songs.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How much does a license cost, and how long do they last?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>
    Our Content Creator Licenses last for 20 months at a time. Payments for our licenses work in 2 ways:</p>
    <ul class="ml-3">
      <li>YouTube: $10 USD per month for 20 months, or pre-pay $200 for the full 20 months.</li>
      <li>Twitch or Mixer: $5 USD each per month for 20 months, or pre-pay $100 each for the full 20 months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each full license is valid for 20 months long. This means that once you have fully paid for the license, any content that you upload during those 20 months will be claim-free forever.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What will happen if I cancel my subscription before 20 months?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>If you cancel before the 20 months, the videos you uploaded during the time you were paying monthly become subject to copyright claims again. If you cancel your licence, you may resume it whenever you'd like.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">I have a Twitch/Mixer and YouTube Channel. Is there a license deal for both together?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>No, our licenses are per platform, per account/channel. For example, if you have a Twitch and YouTube account, you will need 2 separate licenses.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">With a Content Creator License, can I include Monstercat music in an advertisement or video with a paid product placement?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>No, you will need to fill out your licensing request <a href="https://www.monstercat.com/sync">here</a> and our Publishing team will get back to you with a quote for Commercial Licensing. Content Creators may also license individual tracks through our Commercial Licensing if they prefer.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">As a corporate entity, am I allowed to take advantage of the Content Creator License?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>No, this would be considered commercial use and the sponsoring company would need to purchase a <a href="https://www.monstercat.com/sync">Commercial License</a>.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">I redeemed my Humble Bundle code, but I cannot download music anymore, what happened?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>The Humble Bundle package comes with 1 year of the Twitch Content Creator License, but only 30 days of the Gold subscription. The Twitch Content Creator License gives you permission to use our music in your streams, but it's the Gold that lets you download tracks from Monstercat.com. Your license is still active and you can keep using that, but to download, you'll need to purchase Monstercat Gold.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">I live in Germany - how can I pay/sign up for a Gold subscription/license?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>The best option to do so would be to search for prepaid credit cards online and buy one of those with PayPal, then use that credit card to sign up for Gold or a license using Stripe.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What is Monstercat Gold?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Our Monstercat Gold subscription for $5/month gives you access to download our entire catalog in a format of your choosing - MP3, WAV or FLAC. It also gives subscribers early streaming access (20 hrs prior) to our new releases, discounts in the shop, access to a private Discord Chat, subreddit flair, as well as the guarantee that our artists will be getting fairly compensated.</p>
  <p>Our catalog only contains songs that are released on our label, so even though we may have an artist listed, it doesn't mean that all of their songs will be available through our website. If you choose to end or cancel your subscription, you will still have the tracks that you downloaded while you still had your subscription active.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do I download FLAC/WAV formats with Monstercat Gold?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>In order to choose your prefered download format, go to the Account page and edit your "Preferred Download Format" under Settings.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How long will it take for my Channel to be whitelisted?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Once you purchase a license, your channel should be almost immediately added to our whitelist.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If I've just purchased a license, will copyright claims on my previous videos be automatically removed?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Buying a license does NOT remove any existing claims. You can manually remove the claims using our Claim Release page here. Make sure you are logged into your Monstercat.com account when you are releasing the claims.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">If I received a claim even though I already purchased a license, what do I do?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Sometimes YouTube can accidentally claim videos on channels that are on our whitelist. In this case, you can try to manually release the claim from our Claim Release page here. Make sure you are logged into your Monstercat.com account when you are releasing the claims.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What are "Non-Licensable" tracks?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>Non-Licensable tracks are tracks that cannot be used with our licenses. You can see the list of tracks here.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a way to ensure I don't play any Non-Licensable tracks?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>You can do this through your Monstercat.com account. Go to the "Account" tab, and check the "Skip Non-licensable Tracks" box.</p>

<button class="accordion">How do I change my payment information?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>To change your payment information, you will need to cancel your license, then resume it - once you resume, you will be able to enter in your new payment information.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">How do I cancel my license/subscription?</button>
<div class="accordionpanel">
  <p>You can cancel your subscription by logging on to your Monstercat.com account, going to the "Gold" tab up at the top, then click on "MANAGE SUBSCRIPTION"</p>
